## For Bypassing the yelp CORS error

go to https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere project and run the project. As yelp api does not support CORS in frontend developement thats why we have bypass the CORS rules through this node server.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
